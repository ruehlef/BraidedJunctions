# BraidedJunctions

This package has been developed to carry out basic computations for string junctions and torus knots/links. It contains functions used in [arXiv:16xx.xxxxx] by Antonella Grassi, Jim Halverson, Fabian Ruehle and Julius Shaneson. It was written by Fabian Ruehle.

To install the package copy the BraidedJunctions.m file to the $UserBaseDirectory directory of your Mathematica installation (run $UserBaseDirectory in Mathematica to see the path). Or just put it somewhere else where Mathematica can find it. All functions come with a help which can be accessed from within mathematica by executing ?functionName

The file BraidedJunctions_Examples.nb is a mathematica notebook file which contains all examples from the paper. 

The main focus is on computing group theory related information for string junction vectors and how they behave under an action induced by a torus knot or link. The conventions used here (e.g. for the vanishing cycles, braiding, ...) are the ones used and explained in the paper. Please make sure you either use these conventions or adapt the code according to your conventions. 

See https://github.com/jhhalverson/py-junctions for an implementation of similar string junction manipluation in Python.
